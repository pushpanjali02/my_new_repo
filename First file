Hii, in the file i am going to make some commits.
-->I am going to tell you how to log in into your git hub account in any computer or mobile or in any device after creating it.
-->The first step would be you have to enter your mail id that you have used while creating the git hub account.
-->Next would be you have enter your password.
-->Then you will get a verification code to your registered mail id.
-->Then enter your code , usually it is a 5 to 6 digital code which you have to enter later.
-->That' s it you will be redirected to your git hub account and make your things from then onwards and you don' t need anything else.
Next we will discuss about the branches.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we will learn how to create a branch and how to make pull request so that we add the changes made in the new branch to the main branch
--->When we create a repository we will be in the main branch and when we want to make some experiments like if required later then only we will include these to the main branch like this.
-->To create a new ranch on the screen we can see a button like "main" just click on it.
-->Then type any name you want without any spaces you can use the undescores instead.
-->And your new branch will be created.
