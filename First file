Hii, in the file i am going to make some commits.
-->I am going to tell you how to log in into your git hub account in any computer or mobile or in any device after creating it.
-->The first step would be you have to enter your mail id that you have used while creating the git hub account.
-->Next would be you have enter your password.
-->Then you will get a verification code to your registered mail id.
-->Then enter your code.
-->That' s it you will be redirected to your git hub account and make your things from then onwards and you don' t need anything else.
